She is currently a post-doctoral research associate at the Centre of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Sciences (Pharmacen™), NWU, Potchefstroom under the supervision of Professor J.D. Steyn, where she conducts data analyses. Part of her post-doctoral responsibilities entail guidance, supervision and mentoring of undergraduate and post-graduate students. Furthermore, she is the director and trainer of Conquest Analytics and Training, which is a consulting company specialising in data analysis and data skills training. She is passionate about research (specifically genetics) and teaching foundational computational skills. She believes that the extraordinary advancement of technology, particularly in Life Sciences, has made bioinformatics skills crucial to ensure people acquire the necessary skills and competencies to survive and contribute to the rapidly changing society. As a result, she certified as a Carpentries instructor in 2016, teaching foundational computational skills at 2-day hands-on workshops. She then attended the first CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School in Trieste, Italy, in 2016, and returned in 2017 as a helper. She taught at the first South African Summer School in January 2020, and joined the Summer School Working Group as a co-chair to help strategise, co-organise and co-teach at these Summer Schools worldwide and help to develop the train-the-trainer model.

I also helped organize a summit meeting of grassroots groups trying to improve inclusion and diversity in the tech sector, edited a book on evidence-based software engineering and a series on software architecture, and wrote some more children's books.<br><br>I left Software Carpentry in January 2017, and after a brief stints with Rangle.io (sponsors of the wonderful Bridge program) and DataCamp (which ended badly), I am now in the Education group at RStudio, makers of a world-class IDE and other fine tools. My main responsibility is RStudio's instructor training and certification program, but my job gives me a chance to do a lot of other things, including a book called Teaching Tech Together and another on JavaScript for data scientists.

There have been a lot of posts recently about CarpentryCon @ Home, but we wanted 
to offer one more to help people navigate the event. There are so many sessions 
offered, it might be hard to know where to start! The post organises the sessions 
by theme, so you can find sessions related to your interests. 

> A big thank you to [Alfred P. Sloan foundation](https://sloan.org/) for making CarpentryCon 2020 possible.
